Prime Minister Narendra Modi on July 26 called out Pakistan’s support to proxy war in Jammu and Kashmir and said the enemy will be given a befitting reply. The remarks came in the backdrop of growing militant attacks in the Jammu region.  “Pakistan has failed in all its nefarious attempts in the past. Pakistan, however, has not learnt from history. It is trying to keep itself relevant by supporting terrorism and proxy war. I am speaking from a place where the masters of terror can hear my voice directly — I want to tell these patrons of terrorism that their nefarious intentions will never succeed. Our soldiers will crush terrorism with full force and the enemy will be given a befitting reply,” Mr. Modi said. The Prime Minister was speaking at the 25th anniversary of the 1999 Kargil war, which is observed as ‘Vijay Diwas’. He also paid homage to war heroes at the War Memorial, Drass, in Kargil district.PM Modi slams Pakistan’s terror tactics

PM Modi recalled the Indian Army’s anti-enemy operations launched from the peaks of the Himalayas. “India wanted peace, but the enemy showed its dual face. Finally, falsehood was defeated. The victory in the Kargil war showed our commitment towards our nation and the valour of our brave forces. Our forces successfully executed the operation despite the extreme and challenging battle conditions,” he said.

The entire nation is highly indebted to the martyrs of the Kargil war,” PM Modi said.The shift to ‘peace and harmony’The Prime Minister pledged that India would defeat every challenge that hinders the development of Ladakh or Jammu & Kashmir. “It will be five years since Article 370 was abolished in August. Jammu & Kashmir is staring at a bright future, talking about big dreams. Besides infrastructure development, the tourism sector is also growing rapidly in Ladakh and J&K,” he said.He said it was after August 5, 2019, cinema halls in Kashmir have re-opened. “After three and a half decades, Tazia procession (of Shia Muslims) was carried out in Srinagar for the first time. J&K held a successful G-20 meeting. Our heaven on earth is rapidly moving towards

held a successful G-20 meeting. Our heaven on earth is rapidly moving towards peace and harmony,” he said.Referring to ₹6000 crore budgetary allocation to the Union Territory of Ladakh, which is a quantum jump from earlier ₹1100 crore, Mr. Modi said Ladakh was chasing new dreams and touching new heights. “Ladakh will soon have a 4G network and the 13-km Zojila tunnel, an all-weather route, will also be completed,” he added.PM Modi targeted the Congress for its failure to meet the demands of the armed forces in the past. “The Congress failed to meet the demands of forces, including the Army and Indian Air Force (IAF). These demands fell on the deaf ears in the past. There was a huge yearning for reforms. Our government took a step to listen to the forces and today we have a list of 5000 weapons that are no longer being exported from outside,” he said.Defending the Agnipath scheme, PM Modi said, “It is an example of the necessary reforms done by the Army. For some people, the Army was meant for saluting

reforms done by the Army. For some people, the Army was meant for saluting politicians and parades. But the Army means the faith of 140 crore countrymen. The goal of the Agnipath scheme is to make the Army young, to keep the Army continuously fit for war.”Referring to the Opposition’s criticism of the Agnipath scheme, PM Modi said, “Unfortunately, people have made such a sensitive issue related to national security a subject of politics. These are the same people who weakened our Army by committing scams worth thousands of crores in the Army. These people never wanted the Army and IAF to be self-reliant. They never wanted Tejas to be introduced in IAF.”Meanwhile, PM Modi virtually carried out the first blast of the Shinkun La Tunnel project. It consists of a 4.1-km long twin-tube tunnel which is under construction at an altitude of around 15,800 feet on the Nimu-Padum-Darcha Road. It will be the first all-weather connectivity to Leh through Himachal Pradesh and also the highest tunnel in the world.

Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra said Kargil Vijay Diwas is that golden page of Indian military history which reminds us of the valour and sacrifice of our brave soldiers. “In the Kargil War, the brave soldiers of our army, while facing difficult conditions, put their lives at stake and drove away the enemy and made the country proud by hoisting the tricolour on the high peaks of the Himalayas,” she said. “Salute to all the brave soldiers who made the supreme sacrifice to protect the country!
